    "The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for one’s own analysis. The database covers approximately 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns with their descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `country` (text): 3 character country code corresponding to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 specification [4]\n",
    "- `country_long` (text): longer form of the country designation\n",
    "- `name` (text): name or title of the power plant, generally in Romanized form\n",
    "- `gppd_idnr` (text): 10 or 12 character identifier for the power plant\n",
    "- `capacity_mw` (number): electrical generating capacity in megawatts\n",
    "- `latitude` (number): geolocation in decimal degrees; WGS84 (EPSG:4326)\n",
    "- `longitude` (number): geolocation in decimal degrees; WGS84 (EPSG:4326)\n",
    "- `fuel (text): energy source used in electricity generation or export\n",
    "- `commissioning_year` (number): year of plant operation, weighted by unit-capacity when data is available\n",
    "- `owner` (text): majority shareholder of the power plant, generally in Romanized form\n",
    "- `source` (text): entity reporting the data; could be an organization, report, or document, generally in Romanized form\n",
    "- `url` (text): web document corresponding to the `source` field\n",
    "- `geolocation_source` (text): attribution for geolocation information\n",
